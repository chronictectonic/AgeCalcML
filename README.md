# AgeCalcML
Arizona LaserChron Center U-Pb Data Reduction Software

AgeCalcML requires the free MATLAB Runtime Compiler version 9.5. There are separate compilers for Mac and Windows. Runtime is accessed by the programs completely behind the scenes, very similar to Java. Like Java, this will need to be updated with new deployments of the program. We anticipate this will happen about once a year.

Here are the links! (click to start download). Follow all of the default settings.
